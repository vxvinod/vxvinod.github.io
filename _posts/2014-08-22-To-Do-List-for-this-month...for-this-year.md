####To Do List for this month...for this year

> Its never late to start until you really start.

It suits for me, when i checked my last blog post here it was a month ago. i was little bit worried , there were days where i used to blog daily with some small technical skills and those learning were really useful because it is been written. but now i felt why i am not updating my blog and something my heart was saying that you need to do manythings but what to do first is my question. so i immediately decided to write a post what you have planned to do in this month and what you are planning to do in this year. planning makes 50% of our work done. so i am here to plan lets get started with it.
